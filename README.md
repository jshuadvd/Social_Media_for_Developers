# Social_Media_for_Developers
This is the List of Social Media Resources for Developers by Siraj Raval on Youtube

### Organizations

There are a handful of well-known organizations that are dedicated to furthering AI research and development. Below are the ones with websites/blogs and Twitter accounts.

* [OpenAI][6] / [Twitter][7] (127K followers)
* [DeepMind][8] / [Twitter][9] (80K followers)
* [Google Research][10] / [Twitter][11] (1.1M followers)
* [AWS AI][12] / [Twitter][13] (1.4M followers)
* [Facebook AI Research][14] (no Twitter :)
* [Microsoft Research][15] / [Twitter][16] (341K followers)
* [Baidu Research][17] / [Twitter][18] (18K followers)
* [IntelAI][19] / [Twitter][20] (2K followers)
* [AI²][21] / [Twitter][22] (4.6K followers)
* [Partnership on AI][23] / [Twitter][24] (5K followers)

### Video Courses

There are an overwhelming number of video courses and tutorials available online now — many of them free. There are some good paid options too, but for this article, I'm focusing exclusively on free content. There are considerably more college courses where the professor has made the course materials available online, but there are no videos. Those can be more challenging to follow along and you probably don't need them. The following courses would keep you busy for months:

### YouTube

Below I include links to YouTube channels or users that have regular content that is AI or machine learning-related. I've ordered by subscriber/view count to give a sense of their popularity.

* [sentdex][25] (225K subscribers, 21M views)
* [Two Minute Papers][27] (60K subscribers, 3.3M views)
* [DeepLearning.TV][28] (42K subscribers, 1.7M views)
* [Data School][29] (37K subscribers, 1.8M views)
* [Machine Learning Recipes with Josh Gordon][30] (324K views)
* [Artificial Intelligence — Topic][31] (10K subscribers)
* [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2)][32] (1.6K subscribers, 69K views)
* [Machine Learning at Berkeley][33] (634 subscribers, 48K views)
* [Understanding Machine Learning — Shai Ben-David][34] (973 subscribers, 43K views)
* [Machine Learning TV][35] (455 subscribers, 11K views)

### Blogs

Given the popularity of AI and machine learning, I'm surprised there aren't more consistent bloggers. Given the complexity of the material, it takes quite a bit of effort to put together meaningful content. Also, there are other outlets like Quora that give options to experts that want to give back but don't have the time to create longer form content.

Below I include bloggers that post consistently on AI-related topics with original material and are not just news feeds or company blogs — sorted by Twitter follower count.

### Medium Writers

Below are some of the [top writers on Medium that cover Artificial Intelligence][36]. Hover over a name for more info. Ordered by [ranking on Medium][36] as of July 2017.

### Books

There are a lot of books out there that cover some aspect of machine learning, deep learning, and NLP. In this section, I'm going to focus purely on the free books that you can access or download straight from the web.

#### Machine Learning

#### NLP

#### **Math**

### Quora

Quora has become a great resource for AI and machine learning. Many of the top researchers answer questions on the site. Below I've listed some of the main AI-related topics, which you can subscribe to if you want to customize your Quora feed. Check out the FAQ section within each topic (e.g. [FAQ for Machine Learning][37]) for a curated list of questions by the Quora community.

### Reddit

The AI community on Reddit isn't as large as Quora, but it still has some good subreddits worth checking out. Reddit can be helpful to keep up with the latest news and research whereas Quora is question/answer. Below are the main AI-related subreddits ordered by number of subscribers.

### Github

One of the nice things about the AI community is most new projects are open-sourced and made available on Github. There are also many educational resources on Github if you want example algorithm implementations in Python or using Juypter Notebooks. Below are links to repos that have been tagged with a particular topic.

### Podcasts

There are an increasing number of podcasts around AI, some centered on the latest news and others that are more educationally-oriented.

### Newsletters

If you want to stay up-to-speed with the latest news and research, there are a growing number of weekly newsletters you can choose from. Most of them cover the same stuff, so you'll only need a couple to stay current.

### Conferences

Unsurprisingly, with the rise in AI's popularity there has also been an increase in the number of AI-related conference. Instead of providing a comprehensive list of every niche conference, I'm going to list the "major" conferences for some definition of major. If I'm missing one you think should be included, let me know. (And these are not free!)

**Academic:**

* [NIPS][38] (Neural Information Processing Systems)
* [ICML][39] (International Conference on Machine Learning)
* [KDD][40] (Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining)
* [ICLR][41] (International Conference on Learning Representations)
* [ACL][42] (Association for Computational Linguistics)
* [EMNLP][43] (Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing)
* [CVPR][44] (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)
* [ICCF][45] (International Conference on Computer Vision)

**Professional:**

### Tutorials

I created a separate comprehensive post covering all the good tutorial content I've found:

* [Over 150 of the Best Machine Learning, NLP, and Python Tutorials][3]

### Cheatsheets

Similar to tutorials, I created a separate article with a variety of good cheat sheets:

* [Cheat Sheet of Machine Learning and Python (and Math) Cheat Sheets][4]
